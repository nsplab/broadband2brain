@Comment {
  Number of simultaneously recorded neurons doubles about every 7 years
  Two main approaches to modelling multi-electrode data:
    - Mapping tuning properties to describe how neurons relate to stimuli or movement
    - Mapping interactions between neurons

  Complete (hardware/sofware) sub-Nyquist rate (x 13) wideband signal
    acquisition chain
  Compressed Sensing
  Analog pre-processing before using ADC to allow sub-Nyquist sampling
  CS theory states that signals with high overall bandwidth but comparatively
    low information level can be acquired very efficiently using randomized measurement protocols

  Energy density of modern portable batteries: 1 W-hr/cc
  10 uW of average power per cc for 10 year device lifespan
  Energu costs and power consumption for typical circuits in bio-sensor applications:
    - AFE: 7.6 uW (NEF = 3)
    - ADC: 2 uW (100 fJ/conv. step
    - DSP: 2 uW (1 mW/Gop)
    - TX: 30 uW (3 nJ/bit)

@Comment {
  Spikes typically contain frequencies up to 8KHz
    -> sampling rates of at least 16KHz are normally required
  Algorithm capable of sampling and reconstructing neural data at sub-Nyquist rates
    while preserving enough features of the original signal so that spike sorting is performed equally reliably
  Sort of allows shape to be identified even with FRI

  1 electrode (?)
  Can detect:
    Neural Spikes: 7.56 uW
    LFP: 2.08 uW
  Ultralow-power operation is very important to
    (1) minimize heat dissipation in the brain
    (2) preserve long-battery life / maximize time between recharges
