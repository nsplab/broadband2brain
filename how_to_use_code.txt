Awful MATLAB data is in final/data

Possible things to do:
- implement new methods with 2 spikes per interval

Figures saved to: Desktop/paper2plots/final
Then use CorelDraw

Desktop/final/paper2/fig3.m

FIG 3
Desktop/final/paper2/fig2.m

FIG 4
Desktop/LFP/fig4a.m -- makes (a) and (b)
Desktop/LFP/fig4.m -- makes (c) and (d)

FIG 5
Desktop/final/paper2/fig5.m -- makes (a) and (b)
Desktop/final/paper2/prefdir_vs_T -- makes (c)

L = # samples
K = # spikes
T = interval length

--- code for running things on all data

final/config/uni_params -- specifies parameters for all methods
final/sampling/generic -- code for taking samples
final/reconstruct/generic -- code for reconstructing spikes from samples
final/reconstruct/reconstruct_and_save -- runs reconstruction on data
